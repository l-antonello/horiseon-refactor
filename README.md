# Code Refactor Starter Code
## CSS Navigation Rewrite ##
Consolidating the separate selectors from the original code ensures the style is consistent as well as reducing the amount of text and lines of code needed. 
    e.g. having three separate classes with the same exact elements can be combined into one

## HTML Optimization Rewrite ##
Optimizing the HTML code is as straightforward as adding the proper semantic elements in place of the redundant classes, mostly the tag <div> with the proper semantic tags that follow the CSS.

Adding alt= tag for images is important for adding additional search power to the site as well as increasing the accesibility for screen readers and/or if the webpage is broken.
